# API Technical Stack

## Overview

SiteWorks API is designed with a modern, scalable, and secure architecture to support construction site management efficiently. The chosen technologies focus on robustness, maintainability, and ease of integration with other enterprise systems.

## Backend

- **Framework:** Spring Boot (Java) – a mature, scalable, and widely adopted framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Security:** JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, OAuth 2.0 support for secure API access.
- **Data Validation & Serialization:** Hibernate Validator, Jackson.

## Database

- **Database Type:** PostgreSQL – a reliable, SQL-based database with strong ACID compliance and extensibility.
- **Containerization:** Running PostgreSQL inside a **Docker** container for easy deployment and isolation.
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** Hibernate with JPA (Java Persistence API) for seamless database interaction.

## API & Documentation

- **API Design:** RESTful API with a well-structured endpoint hierarchy.
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger) for clear and interactive API documentation.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implemented via Spring Security and API Gateway to prevent abuse.

## Frontend & Integration

- **Frontend Framework:** Angular for an intuitive user interface.
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and security.
- **Message Queue:** Apache Kafka for real-time event-driven processing.
- **WebSockets:** For real-time updates on construction site progress.

## Deployment & DevOps

- **Containerization:** Docker for environment consistency across development and production.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana for system health monitoring.
- **Logging:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, JWT, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Data Encryption:** TLS for API communication, AES for sensitive data storage.
- **Threat Protection:** Web Application Firewall (WAF) and security scanning tools.

## Future Enhancements

- **Microservices Migration:** Potential transition to a microservices architecture using Spring Cloud.
- **AI/ML Integration:** Predictive analytics for project delays and risk management.
- **Blockchain:** Immutable records for construction contract and transaction tracking.

This stack ensures **scalability, security, and ease of integration** with existing enterprise solutions while keeping the system **robust and future-proof**.

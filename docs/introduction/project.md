# SiteWorks API Documentation Project

## Overview

The SiteWorks API Documentation project aims to provide a comprehensive, developer-friendly guide to using the SiteWorks API. Our goal is to ensure that developers, project managers, and technical teams can quickly understand how to integrate and utilize the API to manage construction projects, workers, teams, materials, and more.

This documentation is structured to offer a seamless experience, covering authentication, endpoints, use cases, best practices, and system architecture.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this documentation project are:

- **Clarity & Accessibility** – Provide clear, structured, and easy-to-navigate documentation for developers.
- **Comprehensive Coverage** – Detail authentication methods, API features, use cases, and system architecture.
- **Up-to-Date Information** – Ensure the documentation evolves with API updates and new releases.
- **Developer-Focused** – Offer quickstart guides, FAQs, and real-world examples to simplify API integration.

## Structure of the Documentation

The documentation is divided into several sections to ensure logical navigation:

- **Introduction**: Overview of the SiteWorks API and this documentation, licensing, and company background.
- **API Docs**: Authentication, endpoint reference, API interaction sequence diagrams, error handling, and frequently asked questions (FAQ).
- **Product Docs**: Features, use cases, sequence diagrams, release notes, changelog, and versionning.
- **System Docs**: Roadmap, technical stack and architecture.
- **Resources**: Glossary and references for additional technical information.

Each section is designed to be **developer-centric**, offering practical insights, examples, and best practices to accelerate integration and troubleshooting.

## Target Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- **Software Developers & Engineers** integrating the SiteWorks API into their applications.
- **Project Managers** overseeing API adoption and system implementation.

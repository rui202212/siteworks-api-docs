- **Authentication** – The process of verifying the identity of a user, application, or system accessing the API.
- **Authorization** – The process of determining if an authenticated entity has the necessary permissions to perform a certain action.

### **C**

- **Microservices** – An architectural approach where an application is composed of loosely coupled services that communicate via APIs.

### **O**

- **OAuth 2.0** – A widely used authorization framework that enables secure access to API resources.
- **OpenAPI (Swagger)** – A standard specification for documenting and defining RESTful APIs.

### **R**
